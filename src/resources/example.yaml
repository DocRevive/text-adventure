# Format and notes by Daniel Kim
#
# Situations are identified by unique string keys.
# The outermost map has three properties: first, intro, situations.
first: zero

# An example of a multiline string is below.
intro: |-
  It is a dark and stormy night.
  The wind is howling.
situations:
  # "Situations" is a nested map with unique keys each mapped
  # to another map describing it.
  zero:
    # Each situation is described by a description and a map
    # of options.

    # An example of a single-line string is below.
    description: Overwhelming premonition and fear befall you.
    options:
      # Options are presented in the order that these
      # pairs are put in. They are mapped to the situation
      # that, if the option is chosen, happens.
      Take deep breaths: calm
      Run: flee
  flee:
    description: |-
      In a flurry of panic, you crash through the woods in 
      a random direction. After a while, you come to your
      senses, which tell you that you're lost.
    options:
      # A situation can have as many or as little options as
      # desired.
      Venture on: wolf
  calm:

      Shakily, you take a few normal breaths. Then, steady
      breaths. Your breathing deepens. Your chest expands
      and contracts in time with the lateral sway of the
      once-intimidating trees. Your breaths are so deep 
      that you seriously doubt your lungs have this kind of
      capacity.
    options:
      Stop: safe
      Continue: enlightenment
  wolf:
    description: |-
      The world is pitch-black now. Almost comical. You begin
      to giggle. Oh, for the brain of a human. It's darkly funny 
      how we anticipate these kinds of things. One would expect
      such a superior species to have consolidated a resolute
      drive to survive.
      
      The wolves rip your abdomen open and feast.
    options:
    # No options means that this is AN endpoint (ending)
    # of the game. There should be multiple, since there
    # are different choices, branches, and outcomes.
  safe:
    description: |-
      Your newfound confidence has diminished the confidence 
      of the wolves. Behind you, the brush rustles, casts light,
      and emits sounds of stumbling and exclamations of relief.
      The search party found you alive.
    # You can also exclude the "options" property entirely.
  enlightenment:
    description: |-
      You close your eyes and continue. And do not stop. The search
      party finds you, but the trees bar them from approaching, the 
      wind obscures their shouts, and the wolves scare them away. In
      perfect solace, in that natural haven, the trees grow a barrier,
      the rainfall molds a plateau, and the river diverts itself to 
      form a waterfall. And in time, your breaths push and pull the 
      earthly winds, the sun offers its service to you, and the entire
      flux and flow of the planet are blessedly touched by subtle 
      changes in your eternal, all-encompassing breaths. And in time,
      your breaths thrust the planet along its elliptical orbit, guide
      the sun along its galactic orbit, assist the voiding masses in 
      their quests, and the expanding universe in its race. 
      
      You have transcended the times of all humanity, Sol, the Local 
      Group, and the universe, but as a consequence, only you remain 
      in this cold, dark night.
